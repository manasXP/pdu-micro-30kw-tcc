# Commissioning Procedure (Rev 1.0)

This document defines the 7-stage field commissioning procedure for deploying a 30 kW PDU module (or 5-module 150 kW stack) at a charging site.

> [!note] This procedure references the power-on sequence from [[__Workspaces/Energy/PDU/PDU-Micro-30KW/PDU-Micro-30KW-Spec/docs/Common/08-Power-On Sequence and Inrush Management]] and thermal limits from [[__Workspaces/Energy/PDU/PDU-Micro-30KW/PDU-Micro-30KW-Spec/docs/Common/04-Thermal Budget]].

> [!warning] Rev 1.0 DAB Migration — Commissioning Updates (2026-04-22)
> - **Output voltage ceiling is now 900 VDC** (was 650 V). Safety PPE upgraded to insulated gloves rated for 1 kV DC. Arc-flash rating re-evaluated.
> - **3-leg sequential enable sequence** during soft-start: Leg A → Leg B → Leg C at 100 ms intervals, orchestrated by DC-DC supervisor. If any leg fails to enable within 1 s, commission in degraded-mode (N-1 or N-2) — note which legs are active in the commissioning report.
> - **1 V/ms V_OUT slew cap** per DS70005603A — verify ramp does not exceed this rate.
> - **SYNC pulse alignment check**: supervisor distributes 100 kHz SYNC over GPIO + CAN-FD to 3 legs. Measure inter-leg PWM phase offset with a scope on gate-drive test points (≤ ±1° nominal).
> - **Triplen cancellation verification**: measure DC bus + output ripple current. Confirm first-harmonic at 3·F_sw ≈ 300 kHz (not 100 kHz).
> - DC-DC stage is bidirectional-capable (DAB); **V2G firmware is disabled**. Verify the commissioning firmware build does not accidentally enable V2G.

## Prerequisites

Before starting commissioning:

- [ ] Unit(s) received and unpacked; verify shipping damage inspection
- [ ] Site 3-phase AC supply verified: 400/480 VAC, 63 A breaker, PE connected
- [ ] Environmental conditions within spec: -30°C to +55°C, <95% RH non-condensing
- [ ] Required tools available: multimeter, insulation tester (1000 VDC), torque wrench, laptop with CAN interface, 4-ch scope for SYNC/PWM phase verification
- [ ] Commissioning engineer trained on this procedure (including Rev 1.0 degraded-mode handling)
